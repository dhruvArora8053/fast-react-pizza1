# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. when you are out of the schedule(fuck that, there is no mf schedule you just need to do whatever is fucking necessary), the starting of your day, the first thing that you gotta do is to make sure have your first three 1.5 hour bouts in order, before you interact with anything.
